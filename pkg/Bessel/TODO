* Martin Maechler's plans and wish list for the  "Bessel" R package:

** TODO Vignette --> ./inst/doc/other-Bessels.Rnw
** TODO More docu in ./man/Bessel.Rd
** DONE bI() - renamed to besselIs() now works with  'log = TRUE'
** Add (most / all) of ~/R/MM/NUMERICS/bessel-fn.R
  R/I-fn.R already added; need to make these work with *complex* input
  ========   should not be hard, since the Abramowitz & Stegun formula
   are for complex .. though restricted, e.g. 9.7.1 (p.377) to  |Arg(z)| < pi/2

** TODO David Scott: has *incomplete* BesselK  (x,y, nu,..) interfacing Fortran
  code from .... (2010), in
  ~/R/D/R-forge/Rmetrics/pkg/DistributionUtils/R/incompleteBesselK.R (etc: man/*, tests/*)
  and offers to let me move them into 'Bessel'
