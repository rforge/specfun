* R bessel "Bugs": Wrong and correct "Lost precision" warnings in R's bessel[IJKY]()
** besselI*asym() and others => Where are they good enough?

* Martin Maechler's plans and wish list for the  "Bessel" R package:
** TODO Vignette --> ./inst/doc/other-Bessels.Rnw
** TODO More docu in ./man/Bessel.Rd
** TODO Implement simple series for Y() as we have besselJs() in R/J-fn.R
** DONE bI() - renamed to besselIs() now works with  'log = TRUE'
** DONE Add (most / all) of ~/R/MM/NUMERICS/Bessel/bessel-fn.R
  R/I-fn.R already added; need to make these work with *complex* input
  ========   should not be hard, since the Abramowitz & Stegun formula
   are for complex .. though restricted, e.g. 9.7.1 (p.377) to  |Arg(z)| < pi/2

** TODO David Scott: has *incomplete* BesselK  (x,y, nu,..) interfacing Fortran and would donate it here
  code from .... (2010), in
  ~/R/D/R-forge/Rmetrics/pkg/DistributionUtils/R/incompleteBesselK.R (etc: man/*, tests/*)
  and offers to let me move them into 'Bessel'

     	    Subject "Incomplete Bessel K Function"

* Updates and misc.
** TODO Once we depend on R >= 3.1.0,  use sinpi() and cospi() in R/toms644.R
* C code:
** TODO declare all auxiliaries as 'static void'
** TODO Consider .C() --> .Call()
** TODO replace dgamln_() by R's Rmath lngamma() !
