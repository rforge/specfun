* R bessel "Bugs": Wrong and correct "Lost precision" warnings in R's bessel[IJKY]()
** besselI*asym() and others => Where are they good enough?
** DONE `expon.scaled = TRUE` notably for *complex* args to be documented
** DONE `besselIs(z, nu)` should work for *complex* arg
** TODO `besselIs(z, nu, log=TRUE)` for *complex* -- fails because `log1p(<cplx>)` fails !
** TODO `expon.scaled = TRUE` notably for *complex* args needs to be compatible for the
   *s*eries and asymptotic functions  besselIs(), besselIasym(), besselI.nuAsym(), besselK.nuAsym()
  ---> ../R/I-fn.R || Mostly DONE, but
 *Why* is `I.nuAsym(*, expon.scaled=TRUE, k.max)` not particularly good ??? see "why" in ./tests/IJKY.R
* More Tests:
** besselI.ftrms() has *NO* code coverage
** DONE tests/IJKY.R -- add more, notably small |x|
* Martin Maechler's plans and wish list for the  "Bessel" R package:
** TODO Implement series besselYs() for Y() as we have besselJs() .. started in ./R/Y-fn.R  <<<
** TODO Vignette --> ./inst/doc/other-Bessels.Rnw
** TODO More docu in ./man/Bessel.Rd
** DONE More docu in ./man/Hankel.Rd and ./man/Airy.Rd
** TODO besselKasym() - A.&S. 9.7.2 {parallel to besselIasym() which is A.&S. 9.7.1}
** TODO *asym* formulas for J() and Y(): x → ∞ : A.&S. 9.2.{5--10}  and   ν → ∞ : A.&S. 9.3.x
*** for now: ~/R/MM/NUMERICS/Bessel/bessel-fn.R has  besselJ.nuAsymp10.19()  from DLMF (10.19.1)
      and also https://dlmf.nist.gov/10.17#i
** DONE bI() - renamed to besselIs() now works with  'log = TRUE'
** DONE Add (most / all) of ~/R/MM/NUMERICS/Bessel/bessel-fn.R
  R/I-fn.R already added; need to make these work with *complex* input
  ========   should not be hard, since the Abramowitz & Stegun formula
   are for complex .. though restricted, e.g. 9.7.1 (p.377) to  |Arg(z)| < pi/2

** TODO David Scott: has *incomplete* BesselK  (x,y, nu,..) interfacing Fortran and would donate it here
  code from .... (2010), in
  ~/R/D/R-forge/Rmetrics/pkg/DistributionUtils/R/incompleteBesselK.R (etc: man/*, tests/*)
  and offers to let me move them into 'Bessel'

     	    Subject "Incomplete Bessel K Function"

* Updates and misc.
** TODO Once we depend on R >= 3.1.0,  use sinpi() and cospi() in R/toms644.R
* C code:
** TODO declare all auxiliaries as 'static void'
** TODO Consider .C() --> .Call()
** TODO replace dgamln_() by R's Rmath lngamma() !
