Description: Computations for approximations and alternatives for the DPQ
  (Density (pdf), Probability (cdf) and Quantile) functions for probability
  distributions in R.
  Primary focus is on (central and non-central) beta, gamma and possibly
  related distributions such as the chisquare, F-, and t-distribution.
  --
  This is for the use of researchers in these numerical approximation
  implementations, notably for my own use in order to improve R's pbeta(),
  qgamma(), ..., dpq-functions.
