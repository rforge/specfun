* TODO Document all these (or do _not_ export):

  ‘betaI’ ‘err.lambd0’ ‘err.lambd1’ ‘err.lambda’ ‘form01.prec’ ‘g2’
  ‘gnt’ ‘h’ ‘h0’ ‘h1’ ‘h2’ ‘hnt’ ‘newton’ ‘nu.lam.expr’ ‘p.dnchiB’
  ‘ppoisD’ ‘scalefactor’ ‘ss’ ‘ss2’ ‘ss2.’

* TODO b_chi(): Now have higher order asymptotic expansion *and* confirmed via Rmpfr that it is
  much better than internal b2(), we should use its higher order
  down to ~200 and completely "drop" b2() and redefine an optimal c1.
  see R/t-nonc-fn.R and notably man/b_chi.Rd
** TODO in R/t-nonc-fn.R : also have c_dt() etc, based on lb_chi() which has nice series now
* TODO t-distributions (notably *noncentral*, "pnt" etc):
** TODO extract some useful functions from our tests/pnt-precision-problem.R
** TODO extract functions (and "tests") from ~/R/MM/NUMERICS/dpq-functions/dt-ex.R
** TODO extract fns & tests   from ~/R/MM/NUMERICS/dpq-functions/pt-ex.R
** TODO extract fns & tests   from ~/R/MM/NUMERICS/dpq-functions/qt-ex.R

* TODO chisq-Wienergerm approximations:
** TODO move C code to here
** TODO Find documentation / papers ==> for help pages about h() and g() in R/wienergerm_nchisq-fn.R
* TODO src/qchisq_appr.c / init.c : change to .Call() version which vectorizes in both args
* TODO tests/qbeta-dist.R : Demonstrates clear *bug* in R's qbeta() incl 'NOTIFY R-core!'

* DONE lbeta.n(), lbeta.asy() .. __rename__;  add the two  *Qab*() functions to help page  man/lbeta.Rd
* DONE qnormU*(): is "upper tail" qnorm ==>  use default arg  lower.tail=FALSE (but keep log.p=FALSE)
* DONE s() is too short, not ok.  Maybe s_() or s.() ? --> using sW() now
* DONE qchisq.appr.R() in R/qgamma-fn.R and qchisq.appr.Kind() are almost identical:
  kept qchisq.appr.R(), renamed to qchisqAppr.R(); the *.R() version is vectorized and used in qgamma.R()
* DONE dcdflib -- ===> made into separate package (part of same R-forge project 'specfun')
