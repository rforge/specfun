* TODO b_chi(): Now have higher order asymptotic expansion *and* confirmed via Rmpfr that it is
  much better than internal b2(), we should use its higher order
  down to ~200 and completely "drop" b2() and redefine an optimal c1.
  see R/t-nonc-fn.R and notably man/b_chi.Rd
** TODO in R/t-nonc-fn.R : also have c_dt() etc, based on lb_chi() which has nice series now
* TODO t-distributions (notably *noncentral*, "pnt" etc):
** TODO extract some useful functions from our tests/pnt-precision-problem.R
** TODO extract functions (and "tests") from ~/R/MM/NUMERICS/dpq-functions/dt-ex.R
** TODO extract fns & tests   from ~/R/MM/NUMERICS/dpq-functions/pt-ex.R
** TODO extract fns & tests   from ~/R/MM/NUMERICS/dpq-functions/qt-ex.R

* TODO chisq-Wienergerm approximations:
** TODO move C code to here
** TODO Find documentation / papers ==> for help pages about h() and g() in R/wienergerm_nchisq-fn.R
* TODO src/qchisq_appr.c / init.c : change to .Call() version which vectorizes in both args
* DONE dcdflib -- ===> made into separate package (part of same R-forge project 'specfun')
